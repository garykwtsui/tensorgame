# Tensor Game

## Objective:
Mainly because I would like to know what it feels like to i) program a game as a toy example, ii) to train an agent to play the game in (i), and  iii) do this in complete **javascript**.

In this toy example, I employed a multi-layered NN (found the optimal to be 2 layers in this toy example).

## Demo:
The car is completely 'driven' by the model to avoid the aliens:

![Test Run 2](https://github.com/garykwtsui/tensorgame/raw/master/gh-assets/TestRun6.gif)

Note that, in both models were trained from my own game play(less than 5 minutes).

## Pre-reqs:
See package.json.
